This is a collection of projects from my undergraduate education at University
of South Carolina, 2014--. All of these repos are archived, and this repo will
be archived too once I graduate.

-   CSCE 611: CPU Design

    -   [mips\_cpu\_611](https://github.com/NighttimeDriver50000/mips_cpu_611)

        A MIPS CPU I made in Verilog for 611. It was originally designed for a
        Cyclone IV FPGA with VGA output, but the repo also includes C++ files
        for running Verilator simulations with an SDL frontend. The simulation
        is quite slow, however.

-   CSCE 590/2: Capstone Project

    -   [multi\_mav\_gcs](https://github.com/NighttimeDriver50000/multi_mav_gcs)

        The small end product of my capstone project. It is a Python/GTK+
        application that facilitates managing Pixhawk-based robots via MAVLink
        in the field. Despite it being the product of a supposedly team
        oriented capstone project, I wrote the entire thing myself near the end
        of the semester. Note that the application no longer runs out of the
        box, as the Google Maps API key has been invalidated. You can, however,
        replace it with your own API key, and it should work fine.

    -   [ros-vagrant-xfce4](https://github.com/NighttimeDriver50000/ros-vagrant-xfce4)

        VM/container tools (Vagrant-based) that I made to facilitate my team
        members in ROS development. Not that they used them. Or did anything.
        I'm not salty.

-   CSCE 574: Robotics

    -   [old-574-potential-field](https://github.com/NighttimeDriver50000/old-574-potential-field)

        Navigation ROS node based on potential fields. The link to read the
        code interleaved with documentation on my site is broken, but you can
        get the [PDF output][pf-pdf] from the GitHub repo.

-   CSCE 274: Intro. Robotics

    -   [ice](https://github.com/NighttimeDriver50000/ice)

        A project management tool I made for automating building and upload of
        programs for the AVR on the iRobot Create used in the class. The repo
        also contains the code for the final project of that class.

    -   [CSCE274Project2](https://github.com/NighttimeDriver50000/CSCE274Project2)
    
        Project 2 from the class, and actually my first-ever GitHub repo.
